        <h1>Certification Authority</h1>
        <!--first, we give a general introduction about this section of the onlinehelp-->
        <p>
        A certification authority (CA) or certificate authority is the part of a PKI, which is responsible for the certificate management.
        </p>
        <!-- all other headlines and paragraphs come after here -->
        <h2>Responsibilities of a CA</h2>
        <p>
	The responsibilities of a CA include issuing and revocation of certificates. In addition, a CA maintains a certificate revocation list (CRL), which includes all certificates issued by the CA and revoked by their owners. 
        </p>
        <h3>Certificate issuing</h3>
        <p>
	If a CA receives a forwarded CSR from a RA, it issues a certificate for this CSR. This certificate includes information about the CA and the certificate holder, a validity period and a signature of the CA. Please read the exact structure of a certificate in PKI standards.
	</p>
        <h3>Certificate revocation list</h3>
        <p>
        A CA also maintains a certificate revocation list, in which all certificates issued by the CA are listed which have not yet passed its validity period, but were revoked by the user or the CA. A certificate may be revoked for example, because the private key has been compromised. If a company and a department were specified in a certificate, it may also be that the employee has left this company and therefore the certificate is no longer valid. Moreover, a CA can revoke certificates by herself, for example if a signing key of the CA was stolen, with which the CA already issued certificates.
