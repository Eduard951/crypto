<h2>Content will be available soon.</h2>

<p>This plugin allows to encrypt and decrypt text with the grille square, but above all you can also break grill ciphertexts automatically (both for even and odd square sizes). The maximum square size is 20 x 20.</p>

<p>Remark: JCT also contains an older plugin <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.jcryptool.visual.grille/$nl$/content/index.html">Grille Cipher</a>, which mainly is intended to visualize the encryption and decryption process and cannot break ciphertexts. Within the older plugin, the square size is limited to the values 4, 6, 8, and 10, while here this limit is abolished. If you want to learn more about this cipher, please also have a look at the online help of the older plugin.</p>
