		<h1>SHA-3 Candidates</h1>

		<p>xxxxxxx_to be deleted_xxxxxxxxxxxx</p>

		<h2>Generate hash</h2>

		<p>The hash is generated always out of the current active editor. Start the SHA-3 wizard. It can be found in <b>Algorithms -> Hash -> SHA-3-Candidates</b>. Chose an algorithm and the option <b>Create Hash</b>.</p>

		<p>As all candidates support different bitlengths of the hash value, you have to choose one.</p>
		
		<p>For better understanding you could choose the output medium of the hash value.
		<ul>
		<li><b>Hex editor:</b> Displays the hash value in a hex editor.</li>
		<li><b>Text editor:</b> Displays the hash value blocked in a text editor, so the generated hash value is well-arranged.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>By clicking on the <b>Finish</b> button the hash value will be generated.</p>


		<h2>Verify hash</h2>
		
		<p>A new hash value is generated from the editor content. This new hash value is compared with a given hash value entered in the SHA-3 wizard. The given and the new hash value and also the result of the comparison are shown in an output text editor tab.</p>
		
		<p>For the verification you also have choose in the SHA-3 wizard the according algorithm and bitlength, but also the option <b>Verify Hash</b> via a radio button. When selecting this radio button, a new field is available to enter the given hash value.</p>
		
		<p>By clicking on the <b>Finish</b> button the verification will be started.</p>
