	<h1>The user interface</h1>
	<p>Here the user interface is explained more precisely.</p>
	<p>The screenshot below shows the view of the plug-in when initially loaded. In the upper and lower
		components brief explanations of the parameters and the view can be found. The centered component is the
		controller of the plug-in.</p>
	<h2>Configuration</h2>
	<p>
		First of all, a ciphertext has to be chosen in the <b>Configuration</b> panel. There are two possibilities
		to do so:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Generate ciphertext</b> - A wizard will be started. The wizard helps you to generate a
			ciphertext from a plain text by encrypting it with a transposition cipher.<br> Therefore, a ciphertext
			can be loaded from a file, from an opened editor window in JCrypTool or the text can be inserted directly.
			Next the length of the key of encryption can be chosen. This number indicates in how many columns in the
			lower table the text will be divided. Via drag'n'drop the table columns can easily be swapped and the key
			of encryption can be changed.<br> By pressing on Finish the encoded text will be loaded to the Ant
			Colony Optimization plug-in.</li>
		<li><b>Insert ciphertext directly</b> - Alternatively, a pre-encoded text can be inserted in this text
			field. <br>
		<i>Information: Only upper case characters from A-Z are allowed.</i></li>
	</ul>

	<p>Two important settings are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Estimated key length</b> - Sets the length of key which will be used for the decryption. The
			number coincides with the number of knots in graph. If you do not know this length, statistic test, e.g.
			the Friedman test, in the <i>JCrypTool Menu: Analysis > Friedman test</i> might help you.</li>
		<li><b>Language of text</b> - You can choose between German and English. The output of the algorithm
			will be compared and rated based on the frequency of common word in the chosen language. Therefore a
			dictionary will be used. Further on it is possible to provide your own dictionary by selecting "Load list
			of words from file".</li>
	</ul>
	<p>After completing choosing those setting, the analysis can be started.</p>
	<p>
		<i>Information: The chosen text will automatically be completed such that the length of text is
			divisible by the key length. If not, it would give a hint of the position of a knot in the encryption, as
			some knots would hold less letters. Therefore, it is necessary that the length of the cipher is greater
			than the key length to start the analysis.</i>
	</p>
	<h2>Analysis</h2>
	<p>
		The group <b>Analysis</b> handles the iterations of the algorithm. As in the Ant Colony Optimization
		Algorithm ants are sent through the graph, it is possible to control the ants step by step or directly send
		multiple ants. The <b>Level of detail</b> allows you to choose whether to send one ant from knot to knot or
		directly send multiple ants on their ways.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Knot-by-Knot</b> - One single ant can be send and observed on its way.<br> <i>Information:
				This setting is active only if the length of key is less than 6 and <b>Visualization as graph</b> is
				chosen.
		</i><br> By choosing so, the following options appear:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Animation</b> - Animations in the graph can be enabled.</li>
				<li><b>To next knot</b> - By doing a Monte-Carlo selection based on the probability which is shown
					next to the graph, the ant selects its next knot to visit. How the probabilities are calculated can be
					found <a href="mathematicalabstraction.html">here</a>.</li>
				<li><b>Until last knot</b> - It is the same as pressing <b>To next knot</b> until the ant is at the
					last knot.</li>
				<li><b>Place new ant</b> - If an ant has finished its path, a new ant can be placed. The ant will be
					placed randomly on one of the knots. The two buttons <b>To next knot</b> and <b>Until last knot</b> are
					active again, such that the new ant can be controlled.</li>
			</ul></li>
		<li><b>Multiple iterations</b> - Multiple ants can be sent at once. By selecting this option, the
			pheromone matrix will be shown automatically and following controllers appear.
			<ul>
				<li><b>Send new ants</b> - <b>Number of ants</b> many ants will be sent through the graph at once. On
					the right side in the pheromone matrix you can observe what happens.</li>
				<li><b>Number of ants</b> - Determines the number of ants which will be sent at once.</li>
			</ul></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The effects of the <b>Algorithm settings</b> can be observed in the probabilities which are shown next to
		the knots in the graph or in the pheromone matrix. To see how those values are calculated have a look <a
			href="mathematicalabstraction.html">here</a>. The three parameters <b>Alpha, Beta</b> and <b>Evaporation</b>
		adjust the parameters explained there. The rule of priority \(\nu_{ij}\) is determined by the upcoming
		bigrams, which appear by concatenating the knots and its letters.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Alpha</b> - On each iteration an ant drops a pheromon on the passed edges. Following ant are
			influenced by the pheromon and will more likely chose edges with a higher value of pheromon. Alpha
			determines the influence of the pheromon have over the ants.</li>
		<li><b>Beta</b> -This parameter adjusts the weight of the probabilities of the bigrams of letters which
			arise along the edges. By choosing a big parameter, the ant will choose a path where the bigrams of letters
			in the chosen language are more likely.</li>
		<li><b>Evaporation</b> - A small value means, that more following ants will notice the pheromon dropped
			on the edges by the current ant.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Visualization and result</h2>
	<p>
		If the key length is smaller than 6 and the option Knot-by-knot is activated, in <b>Visualization</b> you
		can choose between showing the graph or the pheromone matrix.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>Visualization as graph</b> - The appropriate graph with the current ant on its position and its
			path will be shown. In the graph, each knot contains letters (maximal 5 letters are displayed) of the
			ciphertext. If the ant has not yet reached its final position in the graph, next to each knot transposition
			probabilities are shown. Those probabilities represent the bigrams of letters which would arise by
			concatenating the knots. A higher probability therefore means, that the ant would more likely choose this
			knot.</li>
		<li><b>Show pheromone matrix</b> - The pheromone matrix will be shown. The matrix represents weight of
			edges in the graph. The matrix is symmetric and quadratic, the number of columns and rows equals the length
			of the key. Each entry \(a_{ij}\) correspond to a weight of the edge connecting Vertex \(i\) and \(j\). As
			in our graph there should not be an edge from each knot to itself, the diagonal values are not available.
			The value itself depends on how many ant have previously chosen this edges on their trail and it depends on
			the probability on the bigrams as well.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The <b>Result</b> component summarizes the overall results of the algorithm.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Number of ants sent so far</b> - Displays the number of ants which have already passed the
			graph.</li>
		<li><b>Current decryption</b> - Shows the result of the current ant. The plain text and the key of the
			decryption of the ant is shown. The plain text can be found by concatenating the letters in the knot along
			the path (the key of decryption) the ant chose.</li>
		<li><b>Best known decryption</b> - Depending on how many known words are in the plaintext (known words
			are word which were found in the dictionary of the <b>Language of text</b>) the result of each ant is
			rated. The result which has the best grading is displayed here.</li>
	</ul>
