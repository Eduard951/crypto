<h1>Ant Colony Optimization</h1>
<p>
The Ant Colony Optimization is a meta heuristics. The Ant Colony Optimization is capable of efficiently solving many combinatorial optimization 
problems, such as the Travelling Salesman Problem.</p>
<p>
In JCrypTool the algorithm is used to decrypt a ciphertext which was encrypted with the transposition cipher.
In the manual the <a href="naturalreference.html">native model</a> of the algorithm is described. Next, the
<a href="mathematicalabstraction.html">mathematical abstraction</a> considers the problem from a mathematical point of views. 

In the part <a href="gui.html">user interface</a> the implementation in JCrypTool is explained.
