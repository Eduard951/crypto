	Double Box Cipher

The double box cipher or "two-square cipher" (German: "Doppelkasten"),
was a German modification of the Playfair cipher. The algorithm encrypts
the plaintext twice with two different Playfair tables, and introducea
splitting of the plaintext. It was deployed in German communications in
1941-1944 in World War II, and broken in Bletchley Park nearly in the
same time span.

	The Double box cipher is based on digraph substitution. Like with any
classical cipher heavily used in military, there are many modifications
and addition to the basic algorithm.
